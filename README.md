# Creative Execution Infrastructure (creativectl)

Production-grade structural validation system for cinematic and narrative projects.

This repository contains a hardened CLI + validation framework designed to enforce structural integrity, motif discipline, emotional density analysis, and file-level integrity protection for long-form creative works.

---

## 🏗 System Overview

creativectl provides:

- Scene structure validation
- Motif frequency tracking
- Emotional density analysis (NLP-based)
- File integrity hash locking
- Git pre-commit validation enforcement
- Streamlit performance dashboard

Automation enforces structure.  
Human authority governs meaning.

## 🔐 Integrity Enforcement Model

- Locked files generate `.lock` metadata file.
- Any modification triggers checksum mismatch.
- Validation is blocked if integrity violation detected.
- Git pre-commit hook can enforce validation automatically.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This system exists for stabilization — not expansion.

It prevents:
- Structural drift
- Motif overload
- Emotional overproduction
- Accidental file mutation
- Version confusion

It does not:
- Generate doctrine
- Override human judgment
- Replace creative intuition
